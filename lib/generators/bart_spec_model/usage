Description:
    The spec generator creates a set of fixtures and model 
    specs that are ready to use as the starting point for your
    application. 
    
    The generator takes the name of the model as its first argument. This
    model name. So "bart_spec_model Concept" will generate a concept_spec model 
    spec.
    
Examples:
    ./script/generate bart_spec_model Concept
