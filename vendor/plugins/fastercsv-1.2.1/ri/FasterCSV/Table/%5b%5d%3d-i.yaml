- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: In the default mixed mode, this method assigns rows for index access and columns for header access. You can force the index association by first calling by_col!() or by_row!().
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Rows may be set to an Array of values (which will inherit the table's headers()) or a FasterCSV::Row.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Columns may be set to a single value, which is copied to each row of the column, or an Array of values. Arrays of values are assigned to rows top to bottom in row major order. Excess values are ignored and if the Array does not have a value for each row the extra rows will receive a <tt>nil</tt>.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Assigning to an existing column or row clobbers the data. Assigning to new columns creates them at the right end of the table.
